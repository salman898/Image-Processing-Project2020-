# Image-Processing-Project2020-

In this Mini project of face Detection and Eyes detection we 
have require some tools and libraries for running this project .

The list give below is requires for running.
   1. first we have install latest version of python.

   2. then we have install "Open-Cv2" python Package for object Detection machine learning algorithm .

   3.for installing open-cv2 the command is used (pip install --upgrade opencv-python)

   4.we also require numpy library (pip install numpy)

   5. we have also Haar-casCade Classifier of face and eye modules.

   6. must present data in the project Dataset folder from where the program select the image and
